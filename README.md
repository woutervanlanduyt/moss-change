# Changes in moss distribution in Flanders
To detect changes in moss distribution in Flanders we selected well prospected grids for bryophytes (minimum 40 species) in two periods: 1980-1999 and 2000-2019. We calculated a change index (method Telfer et al. 2002) to correct for changes in prospection effort.
Species traits such as Ellenberg values, habitat and substrates were used to detect general trends and potential environmental pressures.
